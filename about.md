## Description
This is an undergraduate-level course on the politics of climate change governance. Here, we will explore how climate mitigation and adaptation decisions are made and their consequences for different segments of society. In approaching these topics, we will emphasize taking a systems approach to understanding the policy process as a component of a complex socioecological system.

In this course, we will practice being informed consumers of social scientific research, with considerable course efforts put toward individual and team-based critiques and applications of research findings and methodology.

### Target Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will:
- be familiar with key contemporary and historical issues and actors in climate governance
- be able to identify different components and their heterogenous interests within a policy system 
- have analyzed climate governance and policy issues using a complex systems perspective
- have critiqued and applied state-of-the-art social scientific research
- have produced a piece of research-oriented writing in a climate governance area

## Course Expectations

### Course Organization
This course is held in-person twice a week on Mondays and Wednesdays. Generally speaking, Mondays will be lecture-based while Wednesdays will be lab-based (e.g. exercises and discussions), but we will move things around to accomodate potential guest speakers or other opportunities that may arise. 

### Students can expect from the instructor
-  I am trained in political science, and have additional specializations in environmental social science and network science. How I approach the class topics is naturally influenced by my background, but I will strive to present a wide variety of materials that shows the breadth of climate governance research.
- I will respect students’ backgrounds and strive to make the course an inclusive learning environment by following the course [Code of Conduct]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link conduct.md %}).

### I expect from students
- Commitment to hands-on learning. In addition to lectures, this course is designed with discussions and projects in mind.
- Respect for everyone involved with the course (i.e. students, instructors, guest lecturers), and follow the course [Code of Conduct]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link conduct.md %}). It is especially important to understand that the class will comprise individuals from diverse and multidisciplinary backgrounds. Communication and patience are paramount.
- Basics: do the prep; come to class; contribute to team work.

## Assessment
Here is a summary of the course assignments and their point worth. More information on these tasks can be found on the [assignments page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assignments.md %}). 

Students can obtain up to 105 points during the course. Because the points-to-grade conversion (chart below) is designed for a 100-point scale, students essentially have the opportunity for 5 extra credit points.
