# Politics of Climate Change Governance
{: .mb-2 }
Course site for EVPP 436 at George Mason University.

## About

This is an undergraduate-level course on the politics of climate change governance. Here, we will explore how climate mitigation and adaptation decisions are made and their consequences for different segments of society. In approaching these topics, we will emphasize taking a systems approach to understanding the policy process as a component of a complex socioecological system.

In this course, we will practice being informed consumers of social scientific research, with considerable course efforts put toward individual and team-based critiques and applications of research findings and methodology.
