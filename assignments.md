## Reading questions
Short reading questions will be assigned for weeks 2-13. These will be basic questions (i.e. if you do the readings you will know the answers). Each week's questions will be assigned on Thursday the week prior and are due before 10am on Tuesday. 

Each week's questions will be worth 2 points for a total of 24 points.

## Discussion questions
In weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 13, we will have discussion sessions during class. In these discussion sessions, we will critically review social scientific research on the week's climate governance topic. Questions to facilitate these discussions will be assigned on Thursday the week prior. 

Discussion for each session is worth 4 points for a total of 24 points.


## In-class exercises and write-ups
In weeks 3, 5, 7, and 12, we will have in-class exercises. In these sessions, we will, both independently and in groups, apply lecture and reading materials to produce knowledge that can be used in some part of the climate policy process. Following each in-class exercise, you will have a short writing task designed to distill what you learned. Your write-ups are due before 10am on the Monday the week following the exercise. 

Each exercise and write-up is worth 6 points for a total of 24 points. Detailed breakdowns are available in the grading rubric for each exercise.

## Final research-based project
The capstone project for this course will be a written assignment emphasizing student production of research in one of three formats described below. You will complete the project in teams of 2-4 students. To practice scientific communication, you will present your projects in week 14 of the class.

This project, including both written and presentation portions, is worth 33 points. A detailed breakdown is available in the grading rubric.

### Research design
